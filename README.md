# AngryBirds

# Assignment:
Hi Or,

 

Below is a description of a hands on task which represents technical aspects of the job you are applying to:

 

The purpose of this task is for you to demonstrate the following:

Knowledge in Unity3D.
Basic problem solving skills in 3D environment.
Reading & understanding other peopleâ€™s code.
Best practices in designing a project in Unity3D and in designing code in C#.
Basic 3D Geometry mathematical & physical knowledge.
Show off you can do cool stuff or make boring stuff look cool!!
 

You are requested to create an â€˜Angry Birdsâ€™-style unity game in which the player launches projectiles at moving targets.

 

The project should involve all the following:

Manually calculating & displaying the projectile path prior to launching.
Preferably the targets should move on more complex/curved patterns rather than simple lines.
Switching between at least 2 levels: The player should be able at all time go back to a menu and choose a level.
Visuals: Include interesting animations, particles, shaders, etc.
Included is a code file of a component that should aid you in your journey. Integrate it into your project and use it, I want to see that you can decipher what it does and how to use it. Alternatively, If you have a better way to implement what the code does or achieve better results, feel free to create your own implementation.
Take all this work above you did and create a stunning demo from it!! I want Ariel (our VP R&D) to look at the screen and see beautiful stuff heâ€™ll get excited about. That way when youâ€™ll start working here heâ€™ll love from already from the first day ðŸ˜Š
I know there are many details undefined â€“ theyâ€™re up to you to decide. See #6 in the beginning of the mail.
                                  

Take into account that timing is critical, I will not be able to wait much after the timeline weâ€™ve agreed â€“ I receive something by tomorrow (Wednesday the 27th) by mid-day the latest. Take that into account.

Once ready send it to me (if itâ€™s big email me , Iâ€™ll send you an upload link). And weâ€™ll schedule a meeting to discuss it.

 

Itâ€™s not a university test, so if you have questions, want to discuss details, share thoughts, feel free to call me.

 

Please reply to me and confirm that you received this mail, with the attached .cs file, read it and generally understand it.

 

Thank you very much for the effort! Itâ€™s understand it is not a trivial effort for you to make. Thank you!


# Introduction:
This assignment is part of my job application to Simbionix. I was assigned to build a Unity game replicating Angry Birds.


# Bootstrapping:
To demonstrate my ability to read and understand other's people code, I bootstrapped from the following project
[https://github.com/ggghostmaker/angrybirds](Angry Birds by ggghostmaker). He also published a [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7UDs5kLoB4](video) tutorial where he live-coding the game, but for the sake of the assignment, I did not watched the video and integrated the project straight to a clean Unity project, covering the various required (and optional) features on top of it, while refactoring the code in the process.
